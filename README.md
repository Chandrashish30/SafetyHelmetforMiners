# Mining Safety Helmet Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

Mining operations involve inherent risks, especially concerning the safety of miners. This project addresses these challenges by introducing a data collection safety helmet equipped with sensors, including an MPU6050 IMU, MQ4 gas sensor, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and GPS. The helmet is designed to collect and transmit real-time data, enabling early detection of potential dangers. This README provides insights into the data analysis and predictive modeling aspects of the project.

## Data Analysis and Prediction

### Methane Concentration Prediction

```python
# Code snippet for Methane Concentration Prediction
# (Refer to Python script for detailed implementation)
Temperature Prediction
python
Copy code
# Code snippet for Temperature Prediction
# (Refer to Python script for detailed implementation)
Humidity Prediction
python
Copy code
# Code snippet for Humidity Prediction
# (Refer to Python script for detailed implementation)
In the provided Python script, we utilize machine learning techniques, specifically the RandomForestRegressor from scikit-learn, to predict Methane Concentration, Temperature, and Humidity based on the collected dataset. The script evaluates model performance using mean squared error and R2 score metrics.

Usage
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies (see Dependencies).
Run the Python script for data analysis and prediction.
